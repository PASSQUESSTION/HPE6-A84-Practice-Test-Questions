<p>1. You are designing an Aruba ClearPass Policy Manager (CPPM) solution for a customer. You learn that the customer has a Palo Alto firewall that filters traffic between clients in the campus and the data center.<br />
Which integration can you suggest?<br />
A. Sending Syslogs from the firewall to CPPM to signal CPPM to change the authentication status for misbehaving clients<br />
B. Importing clients&rsquo; MAC addresses to configure known clients for MAC authentication more quickly<br />
C. Establishing a double layer of authentication at both the campus edge and the data center DMZ<br />
D. Importing the firewall&#39;s rules to program downloadable user roles for AOS-CX switches more quickly<br />
Answer: A&nbsp;</p>
